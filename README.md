# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Purpose:
To use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soupã€‚

## Results:
Unlucky, I was not able to get my model accuracy higher than 75%, but my model accuracy score increased slightly with my 3 attempt.

## Summary
Extremly difficult to increase accuracy score and used lots of time training the model, but it has increase 2% accuracy with 3rd hidden layer.
The optimized accuruacy score is 54% which is 2% up from the original model.

## recommendation:
I would say trying out adding more and adjusting some variable would help imporving the accuracy of the model.
